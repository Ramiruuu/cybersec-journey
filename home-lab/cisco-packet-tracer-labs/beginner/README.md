# Home Lab Environment

## Core Components : Kali Linux | Ubuntu | Metasploitable2

### 📌 Overview

This folder contains the documentation for my offensive security home lab—an isolated environment designed for hands-on penetration testing practice, vulnerability exploitation, and security tool experimentation.

### 🗂️ Folder Structure

```javascript
home-lab/
        virtual-machines/                  
                        kali-linux/
                        target-machines/
                        ubuntu-machine/
```

### 🎯 Purpose

- Practice real-world penetration testing techniques
- Experiment with security tools in a safe, isolated environment
- Understand attacker methodologies to improve defensive skills
- Build a foundation for certifications (OSCP, CEH, etc.)

### 🔐 Network

All VMs operate on an isolated host-only network—completely segmented from my physical network and the internet (except for updates).

### 📚 What You'll find here

- Setup guides and configurations
- Tool installation and usage notes
- Attack methodologies and techniques
- Lessons learned from each practice session

## This lab is my playground for learning how systems break—so I can better understand how to defend them.
